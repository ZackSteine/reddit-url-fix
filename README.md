# Reddit New Tab URL Fixer (Firefox Only)

Fixes a bug where Reddit overwrites the current tab's URL when opening threads in a new tab (Firefox only). No permissions required.

## Installation

🦊 Get it on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/...)

## Why?

When you click on a post in Reddit (with “open in new tab” enabled), Reddit incorrectly mutates the original tab’s URL. This breaks reload and history. This extension fixes that.
